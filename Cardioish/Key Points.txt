Key Points:
tpat Function: Simulates the tpat MATLAB function to calculate feature vectors based on transitions.
Feature Selection: Uses SelectFromModel with KNeighborsClassifier to select the most relevant features.
Cross-Validation and Accuracy Calculation: Implements KNeighborsClassifier with different metrics and weights for exhaustive accuracy testing.
Visualization: Transition matrix displayed using matplotlib.
